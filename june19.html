                    Fact #1: 
                    After the Emancipation Proclamation on January 1, 1863 was issued, not all enslaved people found freedom.
                    The freed slaves after finding this out held a rebellion against the United States. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Fact #2
                    The Civil War ended in the summer of 1865. Union General Gordon Granger and his troops traveled to Galveston, 
                    Texas to announce General Orders No. 3 on June 19, 1865. June 19th would go on to be known and celebrated as Juneteenth.
