                    Fact #1
                    Garfield's Creation
                    Created by cartoonist Jim Davis, Garfield made his debut on June 19, 1978. 
                    Davis named the orange, fuzzy tabby cat after his grandfather, James Garfield Davis

                    Fact #2
                    Over the years, Garfield's appearance has changed significantly. In the original comic strips, 
                    Garfield walked on all fours and had smaller, more realistic eyes. As time passed, his design became more stylized and human-like. 
                    He started walking on two legs, and his eyes became larger and more expressive.
